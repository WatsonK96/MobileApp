# Interview Questions and Answers

## Introduction:
Our application aims to reduce or prevent impulse shopping. As many people will find the items they bought didn’t meet their requirements, or add value to their lives, we want to make an mobile application which 
help people decide whether this item is useful and calculate cost/value performance.  The main users of our products will be college students who like shopping and may have economic issues.

## Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments:
For our projects we predict that the younger crowd would likely be in need of something like this, older teens and young adults that are not as experienced in shopping yet we also don’t think gender will be a huge deciding factor in this. We see somewhere that may be commonly shopped at being a potentially big issue area, like  grocery stores and big chain retailers or maybe niche markets (clothing and crafting maybe). We also do not know for sure that everyone we interview has impulsive buying habits like we do.

# Final Value Proposition and Consumer Segments:

Our application will help make tracking spending at the grocery store and online easier by helping you see your list and making sure you only spend what you have. It will also help you assess the joy and necessity of the items you want to purchase versus what you truly value.

Our target audience will be young adults just starting out and learning how budgeting works best for them. It will help them ensure that they know if they are really making a smart purchase by rating the current purchase on a scale of satisfaction when compared to previous purchases. Further, the app can ask a few simple questions to make sure the buyer is mindful and is making the right decision at the time of purchase.
